Output from the DMFT calcualtions are saved into files with three extension types

1. *.dat: These files are text files, and are meant for human readability.
2. *.npy: These files are numpy saved files which contain one array.
3. *.npz: These files are numpy groups which contain many arrays.

Reading .npy and .npz files

First the  *.npz

write following python script

from numpy import load
SE = load('SE_iter20.npy')
SE[0,:,0] # <-- This is \Sigma_{i=0,upup}(omega)(For real space)

Now for the .npz the python script will be

data = load('everything_iter20.npz')
print(data.files)

the output will be
['GT', 'old_SE', 'G', 'weiss', 'WT', 'SE', 'test_mat']

data['SE'][0,:,0] # <-- This is \Sigma_{i=0,upup}(omega)(For real space)

GT is Green's funtion in imaginary time G(\tau).

old_SE is self-energy from previous iteration

G Green's function in matsubara frequency G(i\omega_n)

weiss is weiss mean-field in imaginary frequency

WT weiss mean field imaginary time

SE spatially resolved self-energy in matsubara frequecy

test_mat is matrix containing the frequency dependent Green's function in site and spin basis 

info.dat contains the information about parameters and the converegence for different quantity.

We keep the file containg the observable (Nup_Ndown.dat) for all iteration while  other quantities only for a few last iterations
